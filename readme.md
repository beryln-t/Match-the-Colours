## Game Description

Playing the _Disney Princess Memory Card Game_ with my nieces has always been a fond memory of mine, and was a key inspiration behind the creation of this game.

With age, our brain detiorates and our mental function detiorates. To combate this, [scientists](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055518) have found that just 15 minutes of brain training exercises a day can improve our brain function. Memory games are able to provide the necessary brain training exercises, and have been used even in early childhood to help develop cognitive functions. This game aims to do just that and keep your mind nimble. So, match on!

## How to Play

The objective of the game is find all matching pairs of tiles. In each level, there will be a fixed number of total correct matches. To win, players need to find all matching tiles before the timer runs out. But there's a catch, you only have a limited number of tries so choose each tile wisely! There are 12 levels to this game, how far can you go?

> - To start the game, click on the `Start` button.
> - Once the tiles are generated, click on 2 different tiles in the grid to start matching.
> - Timer will begin running once the first tile is clicked.
> - If tiles are a correct match, they will remain open.
> - If tiles do not match, they will be flipped.
> - Continue clicking tiles till all matching pairs are found.
> - Once level is completed, proceed to the next level to attempt game at increased difficulty.
> - If you've failed the level, click on `Restart` to try the level again.
> - Click on `Home` to restart the entire game and begin from level 1.
